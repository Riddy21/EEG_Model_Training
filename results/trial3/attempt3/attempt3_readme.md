## 3nd attempt - More channels

### Changes made
- Trying the model with different dataset found online
    - https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018211
- Using the LR hand paradigm
- Baseline:
    - Original model, 34 samples per prediction
- Trying with ALL channels

### Expected results
- Takes longer much longer to train and predict, need more epochs
- Should overfit a little later

### Issues noticed
- Better prediction accuracy
- Loss and accuracy drops at epoch 5
- starts overfitting at epoch 5, which is longer than last time
