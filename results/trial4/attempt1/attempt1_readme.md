## 1st attempt

### Changes made
- Trying new model on our data
- 200 sample frame
- Testing on individual dataset with different recording sessions from one person

### Expected results
- See if it performs any worse with our Muse model or better than recorded data

### Issues noticed
- Seems to be able to predict REST well, but not the others
- Our recording sessions are too long
- Not able to adapt to different put on and take off
