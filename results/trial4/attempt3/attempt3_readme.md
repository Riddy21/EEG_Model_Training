## 3rd attempt

### Changes made
- Trying new model new training data from new movement dataset

### Expected results
- See if it performs any worse with our Muse model or better than recorded data
- See if it adapts to taking off the headset

### Issues noticed
- Data has timing issues, this is probably due to threading
