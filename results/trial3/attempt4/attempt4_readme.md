## 4th attempt - Less data

### Changes made
- Trying the model with different dataset found online
    - https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018211
- Using the LR hand paradigm
- Baseline:
    - Original model, 34 samples per prediction
- Trying with less data, same everything else

### Expected results
- Should overfit earlier

### Issues noticed
- Overfits at epoch 3, which is earlier than more data
- training accuracy the same
