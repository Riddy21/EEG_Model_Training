## 5th attempt - More data 

### Changes made
- Trying the model with different dataset found online
    - https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018211
- Using the LR hand paradigm
- Baseline:
    - Original model, 34 samples per prediction
    - All 22 Channels
    - See if increasing the amount of data has significant effect

### Expected results
- Should overfit later

### Issues noticed
- Higher accuracy however still overfits starting epoch 5
