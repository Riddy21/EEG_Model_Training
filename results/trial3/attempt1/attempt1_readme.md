## 1st attempt - Baseline

### Changes made
- Trying the model with different dataset found online
    - https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018211
- Using the LR hand paradigm
- Baseline:
    - Original model, 170 samples per prediction

### Expected results
- Expecting relatively good results but slow predicitons
- Expecting overfitting with relatively ok correlation between validation and training
- See if we can decrease the prediction frame size lower
- Probably not enough training samples, so doesn't reach convergence

### Issues noticed
- Validation overfitting happened very soon, but good correlation
- Needs more data
