## 2nd attempt - More data

### Changes made
- Trying the model with different dataset found online
    - https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018211
- Using the LR hand paradigm
- Baseline:
    - Original model, 34 samples per prediction
- Adding more epochs

### Expected results
- Takes longer to train, need more epochs
- Should overfit a little later
- Decrease in overall accuracy probably
