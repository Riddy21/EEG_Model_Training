## 9th attempt

### Changes made
- Trying new model new training data from interactive movement dataset
- SEGMENT_WINDOW_SIZE = 400 # 2s
- ACTIVE_WAIT_PERIOD = 400 # 2s
- ACTIVE_HOLD_PERIOD = 200 # 1s for dealing with accidental presses
- Balanced
- Have disconnect
- even more data, trying with lower learning rate for 5000 epochs

### Expected results
- See if it performs any worse with our Muse model or better than recorded data
- See if it adapts to taking off the headset
